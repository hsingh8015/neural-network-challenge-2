### Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts employee attrition and department assignment based on factors like age, job satisfaction, and education level. It involves stages such as data preprocessing, neural network creation, model training, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy and F1-score. By accurately predicting these outcomes, companies can gain insights into their workforce and implement strategies to improve employee retention and satisfaction.

### Functionality

The project includes preprocessing steps like splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, standardizing features, and encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding. The neural network comprises an input layer, shared dense layers (64 and 32 neurons) with ReLU activation, and separate branches for department and attrition predictions, each with a hidden layer and a softmax output layer. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and trained for 100 epochs, followed by evaluation to calculate accuracy for both predictions.

### Summary

The neural network model demonstrated moderate accuracy in predicting employee attrition and department assignment, achieving around 80% accuracy for attrition predictions but only about 56% for department assignments. While the model effectively identifies employees at risk of leaving, it struggles with accurately classifying departments.

**Reflection**:
These findings highlight both the model's potential and its limitations. The high accuracy in attrition prediction is valuable for HR departments to proactively address turnover factors. However, the lower accuracy in department assignment indicates the need for additional data features or alternative modeling strategies. This project emphasizes the importance of feature selection and model evaluation in developing effective predictive models for real-world applications.

**Real-World Application**:
1. **Talent Development**: The model can guide organizations in identifying employees who may benefit from additional training or mentorship, helping to enhance their skills and engagement.
2. **Succession Planning**: It can aid in identifying potential candidates for future leadership roles based on their profiles, facilitating targeted development plans to ensure a strong internal talent pipeline.
