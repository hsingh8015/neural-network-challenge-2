For the output layers, a common choice would be:\n","- **For binary classification (attrition)**: The **sigmoid** activation function is typically used, as it outputs values between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary outcomes.\n","- **For multi-class classification (department)**: The **softmax** activation function is often chosen, as it outputs a probability distribution across multiple classes, allowing the model to indicate the most likely department.\n","These choices help ensure that the outputs are interpretable as probabilities, which is important for decision-making.\n","3. To improve the model, consider several strategies:\n","- **Feature Engineering**: Add or refine features to better capture relationships in the data.\n","- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, and network architectures for optimal performance.\n","- **Regularization**: Use dropout or L2 regularization to mitigate overfitting.\n","- **Cross-Validation**: Implement k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness.\n","- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine predictions from multiple models to enhance accuracy.\n","- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Use techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or class weights to address class imbalances."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DTtmKD-J5pjO"},"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.7"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"31f2aee4e71d21fbe5cf8b01ff0e069b9275f58929596ceb00d14d90e3e16cd6"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
